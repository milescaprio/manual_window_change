Change windows using a game controller manual gearbox. Windows-only. 

Currently, this program is configured for a Logitech G920, but you can 
reconfigure it for any wheel. If you are not using a G920, change the
gear buttons list in `manual_window_change.py` to the buttons actuated 
by each gear when you run the program, and the clutch_axis to the axis 
moved when you press the clutch. 

Run the script and you can change windows with your shifter. Simply move
the shifter to bind the window to that gear; hold in the clutch and 
move the shifter to change to an existing window that you've bound.
Hope you enjoy this 30-minute project =)
